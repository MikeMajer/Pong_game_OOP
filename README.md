#Pong Game 

This project is my version of the very popular old school game call Pong.
Game is created using HTML5 Canvas in connections with JavaScript, this time I decided to experiment with object-oriented programming and show how easy we can manage our code add and remove things using this technique.


To control player paddles use arrows on your keyboard:

**arrow up** - to go up;<br>
**arrow down** - to go down;


If you want to try multiplayer option, just tick multiplayer checkbox and use the numeric keyboard to control paddles :

**key 8** - to go up;<br>
**key 2** - to go down;


To make the game even more interesting, you can add and remove balls by clicking on **"Add Ball"** or **"Remove Ball"** buttons.


The game ends when one of the sides achieve 10 points. After that, you can easily reset the game by clicking on the **"Try Again"** option or **"Reset"** button.
